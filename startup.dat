        Now press up-arrow to confirm the data has been entered.


Example usage: Turn on. Press -. Mode letter will show 'A'. Type in an address
               (example FE00). Press - (or any command key). Contents will show
               on the right. Use Up & Down keys to cycle through addresses.

To save a tape, press S then enter start address, press S, enter end address+1,
               start recording and press S. The save only takes a few seconds.

To load a tape, the display must just have dots, (reset if necessary), start
               playing tape and immediately press L. The last digit will flicker
               as the bytes load. At the end, the dots will show again. There's
               no error checking, so if it doesn't work, reset and try again.

Note that left-most digit is not wired up, and therefore will always be blank.

Tapes can only be processed through BASIC. So, load the basic cart from the software list,
and then load the tape.

CLOAD     to load the tape
CSAVE     to save.

A tape can only be successfully loaded if the machine it was recorded on has the same amount
of RAM as the destination machine.

Even then, tape loading is unreliable and there's no error if things go wrong.

To load and run a tape:
Some programs run from the monitor prompt, while Basic programs must be loaded in the monitor and run from Basic.

Monitor programs:
1. Type C100R, press <Enter>. This gives the prompt A9*.
2. Now enter the load instructions as per the usage, e.g E000.EFFFR but don't press <Enter> yet.
3. Start the tape via the Tab menu Tape Control (NOT by pressing F2), wait for the leader tone then press <Enter>.
4. When it's finished you are back to the \ prompt.
5. Enter the "enter at" information, press <Return> to run the program.

Basic programs:
1. You must already have loaded and run Basic (use basica from the software list). Do a soft reset (Scroll-Lock then F3) to get back to the monitor.
2. Now enter the load instructions as per the usage, e.g 4A.00FFR300.FFFR but don't press <Enter> yet.
3. Start the tape via the Tab menu Tape Control (NOT by pressing F2), wait for the leader tone then press <Enter>.
4. When it's finished you are back to the \ prompt.
5. Go back to Basic by typing E2B3R <Enter>
6. Now you can LIST or RUN the program.

To save a tape, you need to be in the monitor.
C100R
Press the Record button
start address.end addressW (for example 2000.21FFW)
When the prompt comes back, press Stop on the tape recorder.

    MINUS - (ADR) to change the address to what is shown in the data side
    Special keys:
        Hold UP, hold 0, release UP, release 0 - execute program at the current address (i.e. 2xx)
        Hold UP, hold 1, release UP, release 1 - execute program at address 0C00 (rom MONA)
        Hold UP, hold 2, release UP, release 2 - play a tune with the keys
        Hold UP, hold 3, release UP, release 3 - decrement the address by 2
        Hold MINUS, hold any hex key, release MINUS, release other key - execute program
          at the current address-0x100 (i.e. 1xx).

If you want to scan through other areas of memory (e.g. the roms), alter the
data at address 2F9 (high byte) and 2FA (low byte).

How to Use:
    The red digits are the address, and the orange digits are the data.
    The address range is 200-2FF (the 2 isn't displayed). To select an address,
    either press the UP key until you get there, or type the address and press
    minus. The orange digits show the current data at that address. To alter
    data, just type it in and press UP.

To play the reflexes game, hold UP, press 1, release UP, release 1.
    The display will show A--0 (or some random number in the last position).
    Press any odd-numbered key (B is convenient), and read off the reaction time.
    After a short delay it will show '--' again, this is the signal to react.
    It doesn't seem to reset the counters each time around.

Test Paste:
    Paste this: 11^22^33^44^55^66^77^88^99^00-

For some reason KCC images are assigned to both cassette and quickload.

SSS images appear to be a different format and won't load.

Games generally only work on one of the computers, so they will be suffixed
with [2],[3],[4].


Quickload
---------

The program may start itself, or may add extra names to the menu. Just enter the
name of the most appropriate one.

If it does neither, then it's assumed to not work.



Cassette
--------

To load a tape, type LOAD <enter>, tape starts, at the end it should run itself.

I assume the JUMP command could be used to go to an address, but it always returns ERROR,
so the jump needs to be done in the debugger.

Image types tested to work are KCC and TAP.

Take note of the filenames - each ends with a 2-digit key enclosed in square brackets, e.g.[00].

Some have an additional type:
 B - basic
 26 - unknown
If none specified then it's M/L.

If the 2nd parameter has 4 digits then it's the start address.



Load the tape: MGLD nn <enter>
------------------------------

So, get the key [nn], enter MGLD nn (it says ?) then start the tape.

If the tape is ok, you get some info

nn/t "name"

nn = the key
t = type
 ? (3F) - M/L
 > (3E) - Basic
 & (26) - unknown app


At the end it will either run by itself, or say ? again.


Run the program: JUMP 0000 <enter>
----------------------------------

Use the start address if specified, otherwise try 0000.




--------------------------------------------------------------------


BASIC
-----

NOTE: Loading of Basic programs isn't working at this time.

PMD851 - BASIC nn to run basic

Others: BASIC starts by default.

LOAD nn - load a basic program.

The MGLD nn command can still be used to load M/L programs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


Getting info by looking in files
--------------------------------

Use HxD to open any filetype (except WAV), look for
a string of 55 bytes, the first byte after is nn, the next
is tt. nn must be converted to decimal, and tt to character.

So, if it says 16 3E, that means the key is 22, type is Basic.

If there's no info, look at the popup to get

Most files load at 0x4016, which indicates it
is a Basic program, however it causes the machine
to reboot. This is because they should be loaded
as a cassette rather than a quickload, but that
facility is lacking.

The only floppies supported are st/stx.

Some games start themselves, but others may just show the desktop.

In the desktop, click the DRIVE A icon, then click on File,Open

Once you get the file list, choose either the TOS or PRG file, and double-click really fast. Now it should work.

The disk system supports folders, so make sure you don't end up in the wrong place. Don't know how to get back.

Some games want [medium] screen, so click on Options,Set Preferences and select Medium.

The user interface is horrible, mouse is required, keys don't do anything.

Telestrat
---------

Completely not working. It wants a boot disk at start,
but it never reads it and just hangs there. There's an
option to use the microdisc or jasmin controllers but
they crash MAME.

If you use the inbuilt controller the maximum disk size
is 526KB - any more will get rejected.



Atmos
-----

Only works with tapes.




Oric-1
------

* Need to use jasmin or microdisc before floppies can be used.
  Microdisc is preferred. Set up at least 2 drives so that the
  non-bootable games can be run.

* Most disks will self-start. If not, enter DIR then the name
  of a COM file. You can run a BAS file by including the extension.

* To change drives, enter B- (for example). Whenever referring to
  a drive, use - (instead of :).

* Disks that have 99 tracks (1238KB) are rejected.

* Non-boot games will have the instructions in the filename.

  So, [B- INSECT] means to boot Sedoric in A and the game in B.
  Enter B- (to select B) then INSECT to start the game.

* OK disks can be selected from the "SW Files" and will auto-run.

Setting up:
- First time run, the displays will all show zero. Hit F3. The game will now be working.
- If you want to change the "Handicap" (High Score) setting, you may have to wipe the NVRAM before it will take.

La Rana is not a pinball machine - it looks like an upright arcade game with a frog's mouth and some holes on a lower panel, while some indicators are on the upper panel. The main scores are on the marquee. Each of 4 players has 3 digits. There's other buttons on the marquee too. The game has no screen.
   It can be played by pressing 5 (insert coin), press 1 (start) for each player, press A (start timer), press various keys to score. Don't press X or the game instantly ends. When the timer runs out it switches to the next player, or ends.

$mame
First time:
- The default settings are fine, so start with a clean slate
- Wait for it to say No Ball, then hold down X.
- Keep holding X, insert credits, and press start. When it says ball 1, let go immediately.
- If you hold down X longer than you should, it says Coil Error, and the game is ended. You
  should let go the instant the ball number increments.

Setting up:
The manual is not that clear, there's a lot we don't know, this *seems* to work...
- Start machine, wait for it to say No Ball, and it may play a tune
- Press num-1 (to simulate opening the front door)
- Press 1, it says BooP (Bookkeeping)
- Press num-1 and the credits number increments to 8, then 01 and on to 17 (2 pushes per number)
- When it gets to 01, the display says Adjust
- To adjust a setting, press 1 to choose a digit, then tap 9 until it is correct.
- The settings in the manual do not fully line up with what we see in the display.

Small FAQ:
- If game shows "Test" just after start, try cleaning the nvram etc. If it still does it, when
  the red screen shows, hold down num-1 until "No Ball" starts flashing, then release the key.
- Game says "No Ball". Press and hold X.
- Game says "Coil Error". You held down X too long.

Status:
- flashman, fldragon, ironball, kz26, nautilus, phntmshp, ridersrf, rock2500, starfirp, theraid,
   trailer, terrlake: playable
- sklflite: can insert coin, cannot start game
- spain82: see notes below
- megaaton: playable, ball number doesn't show. If it says Test, see FAQ above.
- ufo_x: playable. Make sure to release X after the last ball ends, or you get "Coil Error".
         If you can't seem to score any points, hit minus to kick it into gear.

ToDo:
- Sometimes the machine starts up in a non-responsive state. Exit and restart.
- Skill Flight: not working
- Miss Disco: not working (no manual available). Uses different hardware. No sound rom.
- Spain82: can start a game but it's not really playable (no manual available).
   The test buttons are unknown. The ball number doesn't show.
   So, after starting the machine, make sure the displays cycle between blank and 700000. If it
   just sits there it has hung up, exit and restart. Insert a coin, hold X and press 1. Now,
   you need to jiggle F and G and perhaps other nearby keys until the 0 starts flashing. You
   can then score. At outhole time, need to press F,G,X to register the fact. If you hit X too
   many times the machine reboots itself. The machine has 2 capture holes and therefore multiball.
   At ball 2, the playfield becomes unresponsive.
- Meg Aaton: Ball number doesn't show. Can suddenly reboot in the middle of a game. Match digits are reversed.

PENNANT FEVER
=============
The first time run, the display will show the model number. Press F3 to clear this.

This is a baseball game where you aim for targets at the top of the playfield, and the
  players advance towards a home run. There are no bumpers or other 'usual' pinball
  items. 1 or 2 players.
  Buttons: Pitch (Fast, Curve, Change Up), Bat.
  How to play:
  - Insert coin (credits shows in innings)
  - Start game
  - Player 1 is 'Visitors'; optional Player 2 is 'Home'
  - To hit the ball and move to another base: Hit Y or U or I or O
  - To get a home run: Hit B or N or M
  - To miss (get a strike): Hit Alt or Space or LShift; then hit Z
  - To get out immediately: Hit R or T.
  - After that, wait for score to start flashing
  - Press another key, etc
  - When you have 3 Strikes, you are Out
  - When you have 3 Outs, your Innings ends (other player gets a turn)

STILL CRAZY
===========
The first time run, the display will show the model number. Press F3 to clear this.

A novelty game where the playfield is completely vertical. It has 4 flippers and the
  idea is to get the ball up to the alcohol 'still' before the 'revenuers' do. The
  idea didn't catch on, and the game was not officially released. 1 player.
  The display shows Score and Batch. There is no credit display.
  If the number of batches exceeds 9, the 'hidden digit' will show the tens.
  You cannot get more than 99 batches.
  The score only has 5 digits, but the game stores the 100,000 digit internally.

How to play: Press 5, press 1, press Z. Add points by pressing F,G,H,J. Press J
  a number of times to increment the batches. To end the game, hit X until the siren
  is heard. If you scored > 99999 points, the high score will show 99999.

RAT RACE
========
The first time run, the display will show the model number. Press F3 to clear this.

Rat Race is played in a cocktail cabinet, the player uses a joystick to tilt the
  board, to coax the ball into following lit passages in a maze. After a successful
  navigation, the maze changes to something else faster and harder. It's almost an
  arcade game done mechanically. Obviously there is no way to emulate it in its intended
  form. Probably would have been a nice game, but it never passed the prototype stage.

How to play: Press 5, press 1. If you want 2 players, also press 2. The display flashes
  the ball number. Press Z to get the ball into play. The display alternates between the
  score and the seconds remaining to accomplish the task. After the series of passages
  has been followed, a bonus flashes for a few seconds, which you must also run over.
  While one player is playing, the other player's score shows what seem to be random
  numbers (but probably are not). The real machine does this too.
  If time runs out, the ball is over. After 3 balls, it's game over.

The first time run, the machine will show some numbers. Press F3 to clear this.

Each game consists of a flat board with an air-driven puck and 10 bowling pins.
 You must push the puck as if it was a bowling ball, and score strikes and spares.
 The displays have 4 digits and 6 can play. The board has contactors to detect
 the passage of the puck, and the machine will lift the bowling pins out of the
 way, so in fact the puck never touches the pins at all.

- To play: 5,1,(optional: 3 to select game type), any of keys A-W,Y,Z,comma,period
    to activate puck detectors, X to signal end. Press it twice to end a frame.
- To score a strike, press ABCDFGIX one at a time.

Setup is via a menu - there are no dipswitches.

If you see 6 and 9 flashing at start- this indicates the battery is flat, and a full setup is required before it can be used.

At start, the highscore will be set to a random value. Beating this score will award a bonus. Tilting will cause the high score to advance by 100,000.

If at any time you 'clock' the machine (ie exceed 999,990), the last digit will flash, indicating you have a million. All games have 6-digit displays - don't be fooled by the numerous videos of recreations on YouTube.

All games:
- To start, press 1
- Press X to end ball
- Ball counter runs backwards, so 1 = last ball.
- Earth Wind Fire, Locomotion:
    When on the last ball, scoring points racks up a bonus counter. At the end, you get an extra timed part, with infinite balls until the time runs out. Then press X.
