If it doesn't run by itself, it's probably a Basic program.
So, load an interpreter (SA-5510 appears to work well), then enter LOAD, load the tape, then RUN.

Monitor commands (general)

A - switch back to normal alpha keyboard
C - Compare memory blocks
D - Dump memory
F - Find bytes in memory
T - Copy memory block

I - reboot
J - Jump to address
K - Fill memory (K by itself fills all of memory)

For some reason KCC images are assigned to both cassette and quickload.

SSS images appear to be a different format and won't load.

Games generally only work on one of the computers, so they will be suffixed
with [2],[3],[4].


Quickload
---------

The program may start itself, or may add extra names to the menu. Just enter the
name of the most appropriate one.

If it does neither, then it's assumed to not work.



Cassette
--------

To load a tape, type LOAD <enter>, tape starts, at the end it should run itself.

I assume the JUMP command could be used to go to an address, but it always returns ERROR,
so the jump needs to be done in the debugger.

Image types tested to work are KCC and TAP.

Take note of the filenames - each ends with a 2-digit key enclosed in square brackets, e.g.[00].

Some have an additional type:
 B - basic
 26 - unknown
If none specified then it's M/L.

If the 2nd parameter has 4 digits then it's the start address.



Load the tape: MGLD nn <enter>
------------------------------

So, get the key [nn], enter MGLD nn (it says ?) then start the tape.

If the tape is ok, you get some info

nn/t "name"

nn = the key
t = type
 ? (3F) - M/L
 > (3E) - Basic
 & (26) - unknown app


At the end it will either run by itself, or say ? again.


Run the program: JUMP 0000 <enter>
----------------------------------

Use the start address if specified, otherwise try 0000.




--------------------------------------------------------------------


BASIC
-----

NOTE: Loading of Basic programs isn't working at this time.

PMD851 - BASIC nn to run basic

Others: BASIC starts by default.

LOAD nn - load a basic program.

The MGLD nn command can still be used to load M/L programs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


Getting info by looking in files
--------------------------------

Use HxD to open any filetype (except WAV), look for
a string of 55 bytes, the first byte after is nn, the next
is tt. nn must be converted to decimal, and tt to character.

So, if it says 16 3E, that means the key is 22, type is Basic.

Try one, if nothing shows after the first block then cancel

Otherwise use RUN.

If it looks like it tried to auto-start but hung,
try pressing Enter a few times.

HOMELAB
=======


All testing is to be done on homelab3 or 4.

Working ones will have [2] or [4] to indicate which
system it is meant for. Those marked with [4] should
also work on Homelab3.


Quickload
---------

The filename should contain the information on
how to start the game - often CALL $5000 .

If there's no info, look at the popup to get
the start address, and add it to the filename.

Most files load at 0x4016, which indicates it
is a Basic program, however it causes the machine
to reboot. This is because they should be loaded
as a cassette rather than a quickload, but that
facility is lacking.

Homelab2 doesn't support hex numbers - use
the equivalent decimal instead.

Inputs on the homebrew games don't work on
homelab2.

Firstly need to find out if the tape is for Basic,
so load "basic" from swlist. Then use LOAD.

If you get error 18 then it's a M/L program,
so MON then L then the program name that Basic gave you.

When it's finished you're back to Basic. RUN to start it.



If you don't use the Basic cart, the system will start in
Monitor and expect a tape, L is already printed for you to
press enter. Note that a tape will immediately begin playing
at start, even before you hit enter.

At end it will say something like
LOADING GRM0044 3780 01D4 2005
2005 EC00

Use the J command to run it, in this case (don't know)




Note: GRM.wav is already converted to a cart (graphmaths in swlist)

Completely not working. It wants a boot disk at start,
but it never reads it and just hangs there. There's an
option to use the microdisc or jasmin controllers but
they crash MAME.

If you use the inbuilt controller the maximum disk size
is 526KB - any more will get rejected.



Atmos
-----

Only works with tapes.




Oric-1
------

* Need to use jasmin or microdisc before floppies can be used.
  Microdisc is preferred. Set up at least 2 drives so that the
  non-bootable games can be run.

* Most disks will self-start. If not, enter DIR then the name
  of a COM file. You can run a BAS file by including the extension.

* To change drives, enter B- (for example). Whenever referring to
  a drive, use - (instead of :).

* Disks that have 99 tracks (1238KB) are rejected.

* Non-boot games will have the instructions in the filename.

  So, [B- INSECT] means to boot Sedoric in A and the game in B.
  Enter B- (to select B) then INSECT to start the game.

* OK disks can be selected from the "SW Files" and will auto-run.
