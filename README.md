# Startup
This file (GAMEINIT.DAT) is to be stored with your other DAT files, for MAME and derivatives. It's the latest in-progress version.

The file will contain general usage procedures for computers, for example how to load a cassette tape.

Certain arcade games have complex setup procedures, and these will also be described.

The file is mainly intended for users of MAMEUI, so some procedures will reference MAMEUI-specific controls. However it is easy to use the MAME equivalents.

MAME (and by extension, all of its derivatives) has plenty of bugs, missing features, and ways to crash. The ones that affect startup will be documented.

You may submit a Pull Request (PR) to add information or correct mistakes. You can't log an issue - you're expected to supply a solution rather than just complaining.

All text is to be in English with standard ASCII characters.
